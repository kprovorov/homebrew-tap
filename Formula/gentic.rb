  def install
    # vendor/ (the ACP agent sidecars spawned by src/session.ts) has to land
    # next to the gentic binary itself, not just anywhere under the prefix.
    # bin/ in a Homebrew keg is a symlink into libexec, and process.execPath
    # resolves through that symlink to the real file — so installing both
    # into libexec and symlinking bin -> libexec/gentic keeps
    # dirname(execPath)/vendor pointing at the right place. Verified against
    # a real bun-compiled binary run through a simulated Cellar/bin symlink
    # layout; see packaging/homebrew-gentic/README.md.
